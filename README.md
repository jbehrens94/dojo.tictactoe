## Contributing
When contributing, a couple of things are important to note.

1. Every commit should start with one of the defined keywords in `commit-msg`. This ensures consistency and clarity for all contributors.
2. Every commit will verify your changes with SwiftLint. This is to prevent non-conforming commits making it into the remote.
